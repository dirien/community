the community-meetings/ folder. If you have a pressing issue of common interest you'd like discussed, please let us know
on [Discord](https://discord.gg/k2FZ4EBcTj), or simply bring it to the next meeting's Q&A.

For more sizeable agenda items please consider speaking up on the PR of the agenda of the next meeting, or file a new PR
